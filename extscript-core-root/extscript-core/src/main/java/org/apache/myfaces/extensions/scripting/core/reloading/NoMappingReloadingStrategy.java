 *          The renderer is a stateless flyweight pattern the reloading strategy is
 *          to do nothing, this should give optimal results
 *          <p/>
 *          <p/>
 *          The components are a similar case they are not flyweight
 *          but the properties usually are preserved by the lifecycle if possible
 *          or assigned by the tag handlers
 *          <p/>
 *          <p/>
 *          The same also applies to other flyweight patterned classes
 *          like converters or validators
 *          <p/>
 *          <p/>
 *          The only ones which need to keep some state are the ones
 *          which keep delegates, like the NavHandler
