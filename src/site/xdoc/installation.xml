        <section name="Checkout and Build">
            <p>
                While Ext-Scripting is already in stable state, the best way to get started
                is probably to checkout and build Ext-Scripting yourself from the latest codebase.
                All other installation steps will have this step as prerequisite if you want to
                use the latest codebase instead of one of the beta releases!
                First you have to check out the latest codebase from

                <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/myfaces/extensions/scripting/trunk">
                    http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/myfaces/extensions/scripting/trunk
                </a>

                via a subversion client.
            </p>
            <p>
                Make sure you have following requirements fulfilled before checking out:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A valid Subversion client</li>
                <li>A valid Servlet 3.0+ container</li>
                <li>Java 6 or higher</li>
                <li>Maven 2.0.9 or higher</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                After checkout, a full build can be obtained from the root directory of your checkout via <b>mvn
                clean install</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once finished, a valid build is installed, which can be used further on. Additionally you can find
                two blueprint projects which you can use as starting points for your own projects under
                <b>&lt;checkoutDir&gt;/examples</b>
                , which can be started via<b>mvn jetty:run-exploded</b>.
                The now generated files either can be used to be included in a maven install or be included manually
                (please go to the next section for detailed setup instructions)

        <section name="Setup of Ext-Scripting">

            <subsection name="Requirements">
                <p>
                    Before setting up Ext-Scripting for your project make sure following requirements are met.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>JAVA_HOME points towards a valid Java SDK (JRE is not sufficient)</li>
                    <li>You know how to create and deploy a web application within your preferred setup (command line,
                        ide)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </subsection>

            <subsection name="Setup">
                <p>
                    While one of the aims of Ext-Scripting was to enable an easy setup, for now it was not entirely
                    possible for now to get a plug and play configuration. Several configuration steps have to be
                    performed.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A valid
                        <b>MyFaces</b>
                        installation has to be present
                    </li>
                    <li>Ext-Scripting and its dependencies has to be added to the MyFaces installation</li>
                    <li>The paths to the scripts have to be present (see also below)</li>
                </ul>

            </subsection>


            <subsection name="Preparations via Apache Maven 2">
                <p>The easiest way once Extension scripting is compiled is probably a setup via Apache Maven 2
                </p>
                <p>
                    Depending on your configuration and preferred JDK version you can add following entries to your
                    Maven pom.xml to enable Ext-Scripting
                </p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <h4>Additional language libraries</h4>
                <p>

                    You have to add following artifacts to your dependency list for additional language support

                </p>
            </subsection>


            <subsection name="Manual Setup">
                <p>If you do not like Maven or you prefer a manual setup, Ext-Scripting provides convenient meta bundles.
                    A manual setup
                    comes down to the task of adding the appropriate meta bundle (extscript-myfaces20-bundle)
                    to your WEB-INF/lib directory and adding a groovy-all.jar as additional dependency.
                    For Scala support you have to add scala-library.jar and scala-compiler.jar to your
                    WEB-INFU/lib. Note not adding those additional libs automatically will disable
                    the respective language support.
                </p>
                <p>you can obtain both bundle jars after the build from:
                    <ul>
                        <li>&lt;yourbuilderoot&gt;/extscript-bundles/extscript-myfaces20-bundle/target/extscript-myfaces20-bundle-1.0.3-SNAPSHOT.jar</li>
                    </ul>
                    The additional language jars for the respective language
                    can be obtained from the language distributions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However following dependencies must be met so that Ext-Scripting can work:
                    <ul>
                        <li>commons-beanutils.jar version 1.8.3 or above</li>
                        <li>commons-codec.jar version 1.3 or above</li>
                        <li>commons-collections.jar version 3.2 or above</li>
                        <li>commons-io.jar version 1.4 or above</li>
                        <li>commons-logging.jar version 1.1.1 or above</li>
                        <li>commons-digester version 1.8 or above</li>
                        <li>groovy-all.jar version 1.7.2 or above</li>
                        <li>scala-compiler.jar version 2.10.0-M2 or above</li>
                        <li>scala-library.jar version 2.10.0-M2 or above</li>
                    </ul>

                    For your convenience an empty webapp is provided within the <a href="./download.html">download page</a>
                    which delivers all needed dependencies to get you kickstarted.
                </p>

                <p>After having done that you are ready to setup the rest of the Ext-Scripting configuration manually as
                    described in the section blow
                </p>
            </subsection>


            <subsection name="Preparing the Necessary web.xml Entries">
                <h4>Most important step</h4>
                <p>To enable Ext-Scripting you also have to add several entries to your web.xml file.</p>

                <p>First a context param has to be set which attaches the Ext-Scripting plugins to MyFaces</p>
                <source><![CDATA[
 <context-param>
    <description>
        Enables our scripting engine support plugins
    </description>
    <param-name>org.apache.myfaces.FACES_INIT_PLUGINS</param-name>
    <param-value>
        org.apache.myfaces.extensions.scripting.servlet.StartupServletContextPluginChainLoader
    </param-value>
 </context-param>]]></source>

                <h4>Additional Optional Steps</h4>
                <p>Ext-Scripting exposes a number configuration parameters which can be set via context parameters in
                    your web.xml
                </p>

                <h4>Adjust the web.xml Root source paths.</h4>
                <p>Since the goal of Ext-Scripting is to provide scriptability to a running web application, it has to
                    know where to find the sources. For this, a default location has been chosen
                    according to the standards set by the Mojarra Groovy Extension.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The location looks like:
                </p>
                <source><![CDATA[
     <webapp>/WEB-INF/groovy                    
                ]]></source>
                <p>
                    as root location for Groovy files
                </p>
                <source><![CDATA[
     <webapp>/WEB-INF/java
                ]]></source>
                <p>
                    as root location for java files.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following image displays the default locations:
                    <img src="images/ext-default-file.jpg"/>
                </p>
                <p>However in a normal development scenario, it is often undesirable to have the files located in a
                    deployment location, and a pointer mechanism towards the actual source locations would be more
                    desirable.

                    To provide such a mechanism, Ext-Scripting allows two optional web.xml context parameters, which
                    allow the rerouting of source locations of the supported languages!

                <h4>Dynamic resource reloading</h4>
                <p>Additionally Ext-Scripting allows the reloading of dynamic web resources
                like Facelets templates images css files etc...  An additional config param is
                    available to enable this functionality.

                        This parameter points to the root of your dynamic resources, usually the same dir
                                        as the root of your web application.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>facelets.RESOURCE_RESOLVER</b> also needs to be set to <b>org.apache.myfaces.extensions.scripting.jsf.facelet.ReroutingResourceResolver</b> if

                This sums up the quick install and setup guide, if you want more detailed setup examples and
                additional configuration entries
                go to our <a href="./exampleconfig.html">Example Configurations</a> page, which shows
                a set of different configurations.


            <h4>Package Whitelisting</h4>
            <p>The last possible config entry is the ability to whitelist packages. If you have set this option
            then only whitelisted packages will be picked up for dynamic recompilation</p>
            <p>With this option you can point your source dir to the normal compile source and mark
            special packages as dynamic (to isolate the dynamic part from the rest)</p>

            To enable this option, add following entry to your web.xml:
             <source><![CDATA[
<!-- ======================================================================================
    Optional: Whitelist of root packages where your sources should come from
 ====================================================================================== -->
<context-param>
    <description>a comma separated whitelist of root packages which are compiled those and nothing else
        will be compiled during all compile stages, all other files stay permanently as they are
    </description>
    <param-name>org.apache.myfaces.extensions.scripting.PGK_WHITELIST</param-name>
    <param-value>org.apache.myfaces.groovyloader.blog,org.apache.myfaces.javaloader.blog</param-value>
</context-param>

                <p>From a Ext-Scripting perspective, dropping the extscript-cdi war into your libraries dir
                is enough to enable Openwebbeans support, however you have to have Openwebbeans installed properly
                which means you have to add a beans.xml file to your META-INF directory and you have to add following
                entry to your web.xml file:
                <source><![CDATA[
<!-- ========================================================================================
                Optional: enable only if you have openwebbeans working
========================================================================================== -->
