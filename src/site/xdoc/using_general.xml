                Using Ext-Scripting once properly setup is straight forward. Usually it comes down to editing, reloading
                on
                the browser editing, reloading the page, .... However if you edit within a running configurations keep
                an
                eye on the console/log output. All compile errors and messages go automatically into the log.

                As you can see, there is no need for any recompile anymore, no server restart
                everything is done dynamically, and you get instant results.
